Compare recursion with iteration in terms of readability, performance, and memory usage.
Explore real-world applications of recursion such as divide-and-conquer algorithms, tree traversals, and backtracking.
Detailed Theory
What is Recursion?
Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself directly or indirectly to solve a problem. It breaks down complex problems into smaller subproblems of the same type.

# Key Components
Base Case

A condition that stops further recursive calls.
Prevents infinite recursion and stack overflow.
Recursive Case

The step where the function calls itself with a reduced problem size.
Gradually approaches the base case.
How It Works
Each recursive call is pushed onto the call stack with its own set of arguments and local variables.
When the base case is reached, the calls begin to return, and the stack starts unwinding.
The final result is obtained after all calls complete.
Types of Recursion
Direct Recursion – A function calls itself directly.
Indirect Recursion – A function calls another function that in turn calls the first one.
Tail Recursion – Recursive call is the last operation in the function.
Non-tail Recursion – Extra operations are performed after the recursive call.
Applications
Mathematical problems (factorial, Fibonacci sequence, power functions).
Searching and sorting algorithms (binary search, quicksort, mergesort).
String operations (reversing, palindrome check).
Traversing data structures (trees, graphs).
Backtracking (N-Queens, Sudoku solver, pathfinding).
Comparison with Iteration
Aspect	Recursion	Iteration
Approach	Function calls itself	Uses loops (for, while, do-while)
Memory Usage	Higher (stack frames per call)	Lower (uses loop variables)
Code Length	Shorter, elegant for complex logic	Longer, sometimes harder to read
Performance	Slightly slower (function overhead)	Usually faster
Suitability	Divide-and-conquer, recursive data	Repetitive tasks with fixed bounds
# Conclusion
Recursion is a powerful and expressive tool in C++ that simplifies solving problems with recursive structures.
It enhances clarity and reduces code complexity, especially in algorithms like tree traversals, graph search, and backtracking.
However, recursion must be used carefully, as it consumes stack memory and can lead to inefficiency or crashes if the base case is missing or unreachable.
In practice, recursion is best for problems where the recursive structure naturally matches the problem definition, while iteration is preferred for performance-sensitive and simple repetitive tasks.
A good programmer balances recursion and iteration depending on the requirements of the problem.
